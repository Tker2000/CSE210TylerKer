Milestone Assignments

I am working on the Open Ended project with a Budget Manager application. 
So far, I have implemented all of the classes in my design including 
Transaction, Income, Expense, TransactionManager, BudgetSummary, GoalTracker, FileManager, UserInterface, BudgetCategory, and ReportGenerator. 
Each class has the appropriate properties and methods defined. While some methods are still basic or have minimal implementation, 
the project compiles successfully and has basic menu-driven interaction. It can read and write transactions to a file, generate monthly summaries, 
track expenses against category budgets, and set financial goals. I am now focusing on improving UI flow and finalizing remaining functionality.
